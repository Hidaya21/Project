# Questin A: 

# A1: pseudo-code: append the city-pairs to the graph with their respective eudclidean distances
# ------------
# 1. get a pair of cities from the matrix computed above
# 2. compute the distance ed between the two cities using ED of sklearn.

# you should provide an automatic way to append the cities and not manualy as 
# indicated in the demo 

# ----  your code here --------------
